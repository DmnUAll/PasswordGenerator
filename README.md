This project was the fifth app writen by myself. It helped me to understand an UISwitch, UIProgressView and DispatchQueue methods a little further. 

At some moment - the project was refactored to exclude a storyboard UI design. All UI is writen by code since then, but i saved my first project realisation into a separate branch, called ui_by_storyboard(before_refactoring).
